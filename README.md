# Animal Fun Facts

## Project Overview

In this project, weâ€™ll build an interactive program that displays a selection of animals. When a user clicks on any animal, a fun fact about that animal will pop up on the screen. This project will help you practice state management and event handling in React.

### Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to create an application where users can click on images of different animals to reveal a random fun fact about the selected animal. The app will display a set of animal images, and each click will show a new fact from a list of facts related to the clicked animal.

- **Random Fun Fact**: When an animal is clicked, a random fun fact related to that animal appears.
